Alternatively, if you have the [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](Anaconda Python) for Python 3 installed you can
use that for this lesson. The data you will need is [https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172](surveys.csv).
Create a directory for working in, download the `surveys.csv` file to that directory and start a Jupyter session with:

````bash
ipython notebook
````
